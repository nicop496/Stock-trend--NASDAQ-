# Stock Trend (NASDAQ)

## Description

1. Through the GUI, which has filters to search, you choose the company you want. If I want Apple, for example, you search for "Apple" and with the filters you can already get its symbol on the NASDAQ index, which is AAPL. You should also be able to search by sector, country and market cap.
2. Once the company was chosen, you choose the time period.
3. After that, the program scrapes all the dates with their values.
4. With the data obtained, it generates an average to know if the price will go up or down and show the results.

## How to run the program
